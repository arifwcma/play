# Background

- Arif recently finished a PhD in machine learning
- Strong math for deep learning (calculus, linear algebra)
- Can implement CNNs from scratch in Python/NumPy
- Knows RL concepts at a high level but has not implemented RL agents yet

# Learning Preferences

- Prefer toy environments/examples first to internalize theory and math deeply
- Use close-to-real-world implementations only after the toy version is solid
- Teach via baby steps and one-by-one exercises
- Explain key RL math (returns, Bellman equations, TD error, policy vs value) alongside code
